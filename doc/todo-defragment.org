TODO for defragment


* TODO add a proper readme
* TODO rationalize this "fileglob" "glom-files", "filemap"
** either give it a real name, be consistent, or create a proper defrecord for it, maybe even type-check it!
* TODO check for zero length files first, delete them or skip them
* TODO move the log config in timbre to after the config file is loaded
* TODO safely remove all old out-cmd-file's after concatenate! is done
* TODO sanity check config at startup, i.e. ike the directories exist
